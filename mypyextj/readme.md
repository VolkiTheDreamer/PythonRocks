## Installation:

There is no **pip** installation for the time being. Instead, You can put the whole folder in your site-packages folder and just use it as a regular package.

You can use https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home to download the whole folder.

## Usage:

```
from mypyext import dataanalysis as da
from mypyext import ml
from mypyext import pythonutility as pu

da.multioutput()
```
